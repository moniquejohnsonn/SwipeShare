# Robin - SwipeShare

SwipeShare is an iOS application designed to connect college students with excess meal swipes to those in need. By fostering a sense of community and mutual support, SwipeShare helps combat food insecurity on campuses.

## Features

- **Donate and Request Meal Swipes**: Students can easily donate unused swipes or request help when needed.
- **Location-Based Notifications**: Get notified when someone nearby needs a meal swipe.
- **User Profiles**: Track meal plan statuses and view user profiles.
- **Real-Time Chat**: Communicate directly with other users to coordinate meal exchanges.
- **Future Plans**: A social media-style page to share free food on campus from events and clubs. Expansion to other colleges: Currently, we have a custom dining hall API for Columbia University, but the product model is designed to scale and adapt to other universities seamlessly. Personalized user profiles: Include shared interests in user profiles to foster meaningful connections. For example, freshmen (often givers) and upperclassmen (often receivers) could bond over shared interests, creating a “big-little” mentorship model while sharing a meal.
